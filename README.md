# Predicting Fraud Users on Depop 

## Background and Motivation

As e-commerce grows as an industry, an ever present concern for platforms, buyers, and sellers, is the prevalence of fraud, or "scam," users. In our project, we define scam users as users that post fake listings, either of products that they never owned or never intended to sell. Scam users are a huge problem for all key stakeholders. For platforms such as Depop or Etsy, they drive away business, decrease revenue, and undermine the integrity of the platform. For buyers, they increase the potential of getting scammed and losing money and time. For sellers, scam listings can crowd out real listings and make it harder for real sellers to sell their products. 

Our goal is to build a model to detect fraud users so that they can be reviewed and removed by platforms as soon as possible. Our main research question is: What features and models can be used to accurately classify Depop listings as real or fraudulent?
